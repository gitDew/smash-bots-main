# Local libmelee documentation

This directory contains an offline snapshot of the libmelee documentation used
by the bots in this repository. It was fetched from the official sources on
2026-09-01.

## Where to start

- [`index.md`](index.md) — generated documentation overview, quick example, and
  setup notes.
- [`overview.md`](overview.md) — the libmelee project overview and API notes
  from the upstream repository.
- [`controller.md`](controller.md) — controller input methods and controller
  state.
- [`gamestate.md`](gamestate.md) — `GameState`, `PlayerState`, positions,
  projectiles, and related state values.
- [`enums.md`](enums.md) — buttons, characters, actions, stages, menus, and
  projectile enums.
- [`console.md`](console.md), [`menuhelper.md`](menuhelper.md),
  [`stages.md`](stages.md), [`framedata.md`](framedata.md), and
  [`logger.md`](logger.md) — the remaining API modules.

The `.md` files are agent-friendly text snapshots. The matching `.html` files
are the complete rendered Read the Docs pages and retain the original links and
formatting; open [`index.html`](index.html) in a browser for the full local
reference. The `_sources/` directory contains the source RST files published by
Read the Docs, and `_static/` contains the styles/scripts needed by the local
HTML snapshot.

## Important project-specific constraint

The upstream overview includes information about online play. This project is
an offline event: bots must run through the shared local runner and must not add
or use online play. The repository's `AGENTS.md` and runner instructions take
precedence over generic upstream examples.
